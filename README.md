# ImageColorChange

The application allows users to upload an image and then identifies the three most prevalent colors within the image. 

Afterward, users are given the option to select a color from the image that they want to modify, as well as input a new color to replace the selected one. 

Additionally, there is a feature to apply a blur filter to the image. 

All of these processes are parallelized for efficiency, and the results or progress are analyzed and reported.
